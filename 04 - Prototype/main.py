"""
Prototype Pattern - Design Patterns (GoF)

Author: Facundo MartÃ­nez (fx-biocoder)
Repository:

Description:
This file contains an implementation for the Prototype design pattern, one of the 23 design patterns described
by the Gang of Four (GoF). This pattern allows for delegating the cloning process to the objects that are being cloned
instead of manually creating exact copies.
This code is based on the concepts and examples presented in the book "Dive Into Design Patterns" by Alexey Naumov.

Components:
- Prototype: Common interface for prototypes
- PrototypeRegistry: This object registries the current prototypes
- ConcretePrototype: Implementation of the Prototype interface
- SubclassConcretePrototype: Class that inherits from ConcretePrototype

        should inspect several fields. For simplicity, I will follow the example in the book.
