"""
Builder Pattern - Design Patterns (GoF)

Author: Facundo MartÃ­nez (fx-biocoder)
Repository: https://github.com/fx-biocoder/design-patterns

Description:
This file contains an implementation for the Builder design pattern, one of the 23 design patterns described
by the Gang of Four (GoF). This pattern allows for constructing complex objects with multiple properties.
This code is based on the concepts and examples presented in the book "Dive Into Design Patterns" by Alexey Naumov.

Components:
- Product1 and Product2: Representing products with an arbitrary and potentially large number of properties. Their
  construction is delegated to specialized builder objects.
- Builder: Abstract interface that defines the steps that each builder has to execute.
- ConcreteBuilder1 and ConcreteBuilder2: Specific implementations of the Builder interface, which build instances of
  Product1 and Product2 respectively.
- Director: Object that orchestrates object building using a specific builder, defining different configurations
  according to the requested type. It is not strictly necessary to have one, but it is helpful for hiding details from
  the client code.
